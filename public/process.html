    <p>
      Despite performing testing, the Chi Pledge Class was unable to generate the appropriate response for applying pressure to the pressure pad. The error perhaps stems from the way voltage is outputted, or from the circuit itself. The Chi Pledge Class plans to use the Jacobs Makerspace and Cory facilities to conduct more thorough testing using voltage probes.

In addition, while the velostat was projected to arrive, it was lost in transit during delivery. However, it is projected to arrive within the next few days. From there, the Chi Pledge Class intends to construct the floor mat and does not anticipate any difficulties. </p>

    <h2>Weekly Objectives</h2>
    <p>The Raspberry Pi will be connected to the motors through a L298N motor
driver. The motor driver accepts an external 12V DC power supply adapted from a
power outlet. The 5V output of the Raspberry Pi will be used to control the motor
driver. Upon detecting pressure on the door mat, the blind will open if it is not already
open. The rotational speed of the motors will be adjusted by modifying the pulse width
modulation (PWM) such that the blind rolls as fast as possible without swinging. The
motors will then rotate for a fixed time until the blind is completely open or closed.</p>

    <h2>Physical Component Progress</h2>
    <p>Monday (March 25): Made measurements for the wood boards and dowels and trimmed it to precision
Tuesday (March 26): Drilled holes for the pegs, cut dowels, put all the pieces together to make note of adjustments we need to make
Thursday (March 28): Glued together the side panels. bottom, and middle divide. </p>

    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-console" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Rainy weather brought about some limitations to us as to where we could work on the project
Many of the simple tasks took a lot longer than expected, like taking precise measurements and cutting/sanding dowels. Sanding in particular took a fairly long time in the process, and for the future we could invest in buying our own dowels and accommodating our drills to store-bought ones.
Our current process was to make all measurements first, then drill holes and cut the pieces, and lastly assembling all the pieces. However, many of the pieces weren't exactly aligned after we drilled all of them, and this issue could have been prevented if we checked the dimensions/tried assembling the pieces before we drilled each piece. We will end up not using all of the dowels/holes that we drilled.
The dowels and wood glue were not strong enough to keep the bottom panels in place, as some of the holes were not aligned properly on the bottom. To make up for this wood screws were used, but one was slightly off and pierced through the side of the key rack. This can be covered up by a hood for the cord connecting to the pressure mat.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>The previous Raspberry Pi was defective, so the Chi Pledge Class purchased a brand new Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
The Chi Pledge Class performed calculations to find appropriate resistors to allow consistent responses upon applying pressure
The floor mat was registering touch inaccurately and was frequently sensing pressure when none was being applied. Ultimately, the Chi Pledge Class decided to purchase a pressure sensing floor mat as a backup while also attempting to build a second floor mat with a different design.</p>

      The key dishes and gears have been 3D printed and are ready to be sanded and cleaned. The prints turned out fine, but because of the print resolution of the printer (0.6mm nozzle), there is a lot of refining to do.

    <h2>Motors</h2>
    <p>The motors are set up and rotating. They will be attached to the key rack and pull on belts to roll up the key rack veil.
There were issues with the gears as the belt continued to slip off of them so new gears with phalanges on the sides to help keep the belt are being 3D printed.
In addition, new key racks were designed with higher walls as keys continued to slip off the dishes during testing.</p>

    <p> Here are our original blueprints for the Smart Key Rack. We initially wanted to have it placed on the floor, but decided that for
      stability and aesthetic purposes, it would be better to have the key rack be placed on a shelf, and have the legs of the rack be much
      shorter. <br><br>
