      Despite performing testing, the Chi Pledge Class was unable to generate the appropriate response for applying pressure to the pressure pad. The error perhaps stems from the way voltage is outputted, or from the circuit itself. The Chi Pledge Class plans to use the Jacobs Makerspace and Cory facilities to conduct more thorough testing using voltage probes.

In addition, while the velostat was projected to arrive, it was lost in transit during delivery. However, it is projected to arrive within the next few days. From there, the Chi Pledge Class intends to construct the floor mat and does not anticipate any difficulties. </p>

    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-console" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
          <li>Rainy weather brought about some limitations to us as to where we could work on the project</li>
          <li>Many of the simple tasks took a lot longer than expected, like taking precise measurements and cutting/sanding dowels. Sanding in particular took a fairly long time in the process, and for the future we could invest in buying our own dowels and accommodating our drills to store-bought ones. </li>
          <li>Our current process was to make all measurements first, then drill holes and cut the pieces, and lastly assembling all the pieces. However, many of the pieces weren't exactly aligned after we drilled all of them, and this issue could have been prevented if we checked the dimensions/tried assembling the pieces before we drilled each piece. We will end up not using all of the dowels/holes that we drilled. </li>
          <li>
            The dowels and wood glue were not strong enough to keep the bottom panels in place, as some of the holes were not aligned properly on the bottom. To make up for this wood screws were used, but one was slightly off and pierced through the side of the key rack. This can be covered up by a hood for the cord connecting to the pressure mat.
          </li>

      The key dishes and gears have been 3D printed and are ready to be sanded and cleaned. The prints turned out fine, but because of the print resolution of the printer (0.6mm nozzle), there is a lot of refining to do.

    <h2>Motors</h2>
    <p>The motors are set up and rotating. They will be attached to the key rack and pull on belts to roll up the key rack veil.
There were issues with the gears as the belt continued to slip off of them so new gears with phalanges on the sides to help keep the belt are being 3D printed.
In addition, new key racks were designed with higher walls as keys continued to slip off the dishes during testing.</p>

    <h2>Floor Mat</h2>
    <p>The floor mat is up and running. The mat consists mostly of reinforced cardboard, with sheets of aluminum foil attached to the cardboard that allows current to flow through when the two sheets of cardboard are pressed together. Reinforcement with gorilla tape ensures that the cardboard doesn't deform after repeatedly being stepped on. Even after thorough user testing, very few deformities were apparent. A fleece cover was sewn to encase the mat to provide more comfort for the user. After we successfully integrated the floor mat sensor to our user interface, we moved on to connect the motors to interact with the Raspberry Pi. The purpose of these motors is that it would power the mechanism that opens the veil and reveal the key dishes behind.  All of this would be triggered by the pressure sensor in the floor mat. </p>

    <h2>Website</h2>
    <p>The website is finally up and running! What the website does is to display the statuses of residents that live in the dwelling. How this works is through the triggering the sensors of the resident's prospective key dishes, and through the Raspberry Pi, the website will be updated on whether each resident is in the dwelling or not. Meanwhile, updating upon keychain presence in headless mode is being incorporated and improved upon.  </p>

    <h2>Integration</h2>
    <p>Integration between the physical key rack, door mat, key dishes, moving parts, electrical engineering components, and code is almost complete. Upon pressure on the door mat, the motors will run, causing the curtain to lift up to reveal the four key dishes. Dropping and removing a key/keychain into a key dish will update the respective user's home status on the website. 10 seconds after stepping, the curtain will close. The roof and back of the key rack still need to be attached.</p>

    <p> Here are our original blueprints for the Smart Key Rack. We initially wanted to have it placed on the floor, but decided that for
      stability and aesthetic purposes, it would be better to have the key rack be placed on a shelf, and have the legs of the rack be much
      shorter. <br><br>
